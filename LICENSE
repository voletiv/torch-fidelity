MODIFICATIONS:

May 13, 2020
- (multiple files) Modified imports from absolute 'torch_fidelity.' to relative '.', so as to be used even without installing
- (feature_extractor_inceptionv3.py, utils.py) Added support for single 4-dim uint8 tensor as input (in addition to string or Dataset)
- (utils.py) Added support for Subset (torch.utils.data.Subset)
- (utils.py) Added support for Dataset that returns multiple values as a list or tuple (eg.: [images, target]): extracts the first element
- (metrics.py) Added more efficient computation of FID if kid==False (input_to_statistics without saving features of input2)
- (multiple) Added `cache_features` arg, to not store features in cache when False
- (utils.py) Added support for datasets that output multiple arguments (such as (images, targets)), extracts the first element (images)
- (utils.py) Added support for datasets that output non-uint8 images, converts them to uint8 after checking image range
